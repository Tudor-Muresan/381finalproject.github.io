Motion capture and corresponding force plate data were acquired from [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dasmehdixtr/human-gait-phase-dataset), which recorded the required data from 21 subjects walking on a treadmill at speeds ranging from 0.6 m/s to 1.7 m/s by increments of 0.1 m/s. Average subject mass was also given.

This analysis also requires mass of the foot, which can be calculated using the following formula: 

{: .box-note}
Foot Mass = 0.0083 x (body mass) + (254.5 x foot length x malleolus height x malleolus width) - 0.065

*Required foot measurements were not provided in the aforementioned dataset and were estimated based on average body mass.*

As it is impossible to place a motion capture marker onto the foot's COM, its position was estimated as being 44% of the foot's length from the heel.

Additionally, the force plates and the motion capture cameras used for finding marker position use different sampling frequencies to record data (1000Hz and 200Hz, respectively). As a result, there were five force plate data points for each corresponding marker position data point. To synchronise the lengths of these datasets, linear interpolation was used to scale down the force plate data to the length of the marker position data.
