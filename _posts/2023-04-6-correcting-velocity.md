Initially derived velocity experiences an offset due to the constant velocity of the moving treadmill. This can be solved by simply subtracting the velocity of the treadmill from every point in the velocity dataset.

This constant value can either be input manually or calculated from the offset velocity dataset. Since the foot experiences only the movement of the treadmill during plant phase, the velocity during this phase is that of the treadmill, as shown below. In this example, the treadmill is moving at a constant 1.0 m/s, which is shown during the horizontal phase of the velocity curve.

Any value of the velocity curve from this phase may be used to find treadmill velocity, which can then be removed from this velocity curve to form a velocity graph relative to the treadmill (i.e., without the offset of the treadmillâ€™s motion), as shown below.
