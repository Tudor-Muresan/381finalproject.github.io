The same analysis can be applied to different gait speeds, so long as both force plate and marker position data is given. This allows for the observation of ankle force at different gaits. 

Since ground reaction force is the main determinant of ankle force, the patterns in the latter will closely follow those of the former. For instance, the characteristic double hump profile of vertical walking ground reaction force is visible in the ankle force data when walking at 1.0 m/s:

</p>
 
However, as speed is increased to 1.7 m/s, the two humps get closer together, and the maximum force increases:

  <img src="/assets/img/Stance1.7.PNG" width="500"/>
  <img src="/assets/img/StanceForce1.7.PNG" width="500"/>
</p>

Similarly, as the speed is decreased to 0.6 m/s, the second hump is less defined:

<p float="left">
  <img src="/assets/img/Stance0.6.PNG" width="500"/>
  <img src="/assets/img/StanceForce0.6.PNG" width="500"/>
</p>
