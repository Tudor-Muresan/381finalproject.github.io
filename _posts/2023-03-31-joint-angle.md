As stated prior, joint angle can be found using marker position data, such as that used in this analysis. However, joint angle may also be derived from manual video analysis. Below is the analysis of stance phase while running with ankle joint angles shown, as well as a figure outlining the change of joint angle during running. Please note that this analysis was done on running data, while the previous analysis (marker + force data) utilised walking data.
