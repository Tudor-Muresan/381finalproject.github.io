With acceleration now determined, the dynamic equilibrium equations can be re-arranged to solve for the two components of ankle force (the vertical and anterior-posterior), as follows:

{: .box-note}
Force_z = (acceleration in the vertical) x (mass of the foot) – (mass of the foot) x (gravitational acceleration) – (ground reaction force in the vertical)

{: .box-note}
Force_x = (acceleration in the anterior-posterior) x (mass of the foot) – (ground reaction force in the anterior-posterior)

Once mapped, these values can be linearly interpolated once again and fit to a length of 100, signifying 0-100% of stance phase. The final output for ankle force at 1.0 m/s is shown below.
