This website tells the story of a single inverse dynamics analysis through a number of blog posts. While the posts on the site's main page are in sequential order, [the directory](https://tudor-muresan.github.io/directory/) may be used to either access any of the pages or to observe their order. The directory may also be accessed from the top right of any page on this site, along with this page. 

This inverse dynamics analysis was completed in Python and on Kaggle. [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tudormuresan/inverse-dynamics/notebook) is a link to the appropriate Kaggle document. The script was written so as to properly output the desired information regardless of which file is used, so long as the required files were formatted in the correct way. Since the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dasmehdixtr/human-gait-phase-dataset) which was used for this analysis contains data for 12 treadmill speeds, each for 21 subjects, the Python script may be run on any individual experiment. 

However, the same Python script has been saved [into the same repository as this website, along with only one of the aforementioned datasets](https://github.com/Tudor-Muresan/Tudor-Muresan.github.io/tree/master/Python). The reader is free to experiment with different datasets using the Kaggle version of the script, or to simply acertain its usability using the GitHub copy. 

To get started on the story of this analysis, please click below to be taken to an Introduction of Inverse Dynamics. Each page will include links to the previous and succeeding pages for easy navigation. Please note that, due to the ordering of the pages, the 'Previous Post' and 'Next Post' buttons built into the website will take the reader to the opposite post (i.e., 'Previous Post' will redirect the browser to the next sequential post). Please use the links provided.
